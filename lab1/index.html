    <h1>Arianna Garrett</h1>

    <p>Hello! My name is Arianna, and this is my first web page I have ever attempted. I am excited and intimidated, but I am determined to learn it.</p>
    
    <p>I love music and my taste varies so I never get bored. I could go to a baseball game everyday but I prefer going to local games. The summer time is my favorite season.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Old school R&B</li>
        <li>Guardians games</li>
        <li>Swimming and tanning poolside</li>
        <li>Time with family and friends</li>
        <li>Making s'mores with my children</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One of the websites I use frequently to learn and reference web technologies is 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>.
